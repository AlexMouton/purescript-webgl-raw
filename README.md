## Graphics.WebGL.Raw

See the [module documentation][1] for all exported functions, constants, and
types.

  [1]: docs/README.md

This library is the thinnest possible PureScript wrapper for JavaScript WebGL
methods, and is generated by parsing the [Khronos IDL][2] for the WebGL
specification. The library should not be altered manually but by modifying the
generator.

  [2]: https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/1.0.3/

This library is not intended for production use, but instead to be wrapped by
additional libraries providing type-safety and automatic error checking and
handling.

## Khronos IDL Parser and PureScript Generator

To build the parser/generator, ensure you have a recent version of Haskell and
`cabal-install` installed, and then:

```sh
> cabal sandbox init
> cabal install --only-dependencies
> cabal build
```

To run the generator on the included IDL and output the contents into the
correct PureScript modules:

```sh
> cabal run docs/WebGL-1.0.3.idl
```

If modifying the parser, be sure to regenerate the module documentation by
running the default Grunt task. Ensure you have a recent version of Node and
`npm` installed, and then:

```sh
> npm install
> bower install
> grunt
```

This package is built upon the amazing amounts of hard work done by [Jurgen
Nicklisch-Franken][3], from whom this was forked.
